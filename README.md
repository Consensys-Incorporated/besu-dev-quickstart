## Prerequisites

To run these tutorials, you must have the following installed:

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v2 or higher

| ⚠️ **Note**: If on MacOS or Windows, please ensure that you allow docker to use upto 4G of memory or 6G if running the Private network setup, and approx twice that amount for the public network setup. The [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) sites have details on how to allocate system resources            |

- On Windows, please use WSL2 kernels 6.6x or higher
- You can use either Docker Desktop or docker-engine (with the compose plugin) within the WSL2 environment
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/node)


## Usage 

Create the docker compose file and artifacts with 

```
$> npx @consensys-software/besu-dev-quickstart
         ____

Welcome to the Besu Developer Quickstart utility. This tool can be used
to rapidly generate a local public node or private network for development purposes.

To get started, be sure that you have both Docker and Docker Compose
installed, then answer the following questions.

What type of network would you like the client to run? Default: [1]
    1. Private
    2. Public

Add Otel Collector spans to Grafana? Default: [N/y]
 
Do you wish to enable the Chainlens explorer? Default: [N/y]
 
Where should we create the config files for this network? Please
choose either an empty directory, or a path to a new directory that does
not yet exist. Default: ./besu-test-network

Once completed, change directory to the artifacts folder: 

```bash
$> cd besu-test-network
besu-test-network $> ./run.sh
``` 

Alternatively, you can use cli options and skip the prompt above like so:

```bash
npx @consensys-software/besu-dev-quickstart --networkType private --outputPath ./besu-test-network --otel false --chainlens false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Besu only - `java.io.IOException: Permission denied` for volumes

The `besu` containers use user `besu` mapped to user:group 1000. On your local machine, if your userid is not 1000, you will see this error. To fix this either run as user 1000 or map
the container's user 1000 to your local user id so permissions will work like so in the compose file

```bash
image: some:img
user: $(id -u):$(id -g)
```

### Deleting the 'data' folder for volumes

Containers run as the default users and we do not alter them. If you run into issues deleting the 
`data` folder, you will need to use `sudo` permissions to do that.
